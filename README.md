# c-10-OOP-SVG-CL-logo-maker

## Description
In this project I practiced making classes in JavaScript, using the Inquirer Package, testing classes with Jest, and generating SVG shapes. The application allows for users to create a SVG colored logo with three letters of their choice. From this project I learned how to make a triangle SVG polygon and the importance of thoroughly reviewing code that is to be tested with Jest.

## Installation

To utilize the application, clone the repo to a folder or save it to your desktop. Travel to the project using your command-line terminal. Open the project on Visual Studio Code by typing “code .” and then you will see the folders and files of the project in VS Code. Next type in “npm i” to install the packages needed to test and run the application.

### My Repo
https://github.com/perfectblue0/c-10-OOP-SVG-CL-logo-maker

This application is intended to be used to generate a logo and have it saved as an SVG file without having to hire a graphic designer. Follow the aforementioned instructions and then, in the command-line, type “npm start” and then press “enter” on your keyboard. Users will then see a question to which they should type a response and press “enter” on their keyboard. Users must answer all questions otherwise they will get a message requesting they type in an answer. To answer the question about which shape the user wants, use the up and down arrows to highlight the shape, and press enter to select the shape. Once the user has answered the last question, they will see a message saying “Generated logo.svg” and will be able to see a new file called “logo.svg” below the “LICENSE” file. This application allows for users to test whether the classes in the application are functioning as well. The application uses Jest to test and can be used by using the command line to navigate to the “lib” folder. Once there, the user can type in “npm test” to test the classes. In the terminal, users will see 3 unit tests that “pass”.

## Credits

I made my project with help from the Zoom recording where Samantha Randolph, my professor, and David Fuka, a substitute, showed the class how to get started.
